                The Oregon Trail was first created in 1971 by three teachers in Minnesota. This game is mostly a text based story game in which the player is a traveller from the mid 19th century who needs to travel across America starting in Missouri and ending at Oregon. The graphics of this game are limited, and text takes the main precedence. The player must make wise decisions in their journey to resource manage, hunt, handle unexpected situations, and care for their travellers. The controls follow a simple input pattern where options are given and the player uses y/n and numbers to enter their decisions. The core mechanics follow discovering landmarks, inputting decisions, and discovering the results of the decisions. The trend at this time was decision based games, as graphics were yet to become a leading factor of gameplay.           </p>

                This game teaches the player about the historical society of pioneers, American geography, and mass migration. It also offers insights to different locations that the player comes across while playing. This game forces the player to practice their foresight so that they survive during long road stretches without proper civilization.

            <p style="color: rgb(52, 0, 134);">
                Despite having been created in the 20th century, this game persists in being a relevant learning opportunity. More than being an educational tool, “its references in television, literature, and internet memes attest to its widespread recognition” (Classic Reload, 2015). This popular game sold over 65 million copies worldwide.
