                Duolingo is an incredibly popular language learning app. It started in 2009 and publicly launched in 2012. Duolingo is widely known for tracking players’ streaks -- the number of consecutive days that the app is visited. This game creates a competitive environment by using leagues (ranks) that players are put in based on points they earn while playing. This pits players against each other in a race of learning. Unlike previous games, Duolingo uses this competitive feature to fuel a social aspect which encourages the users to play more. Furthermore, unlike the previous games, Duolingo uses AI algorithms to match the user's learning pace.
