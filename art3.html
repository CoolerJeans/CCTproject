                Created by Richard Eckert and Janice Davidson, the original Math Blaster! was released in 1983 on DOS and Apple ll. The game starts by letting the player choose their stats for different simple math subjects, speed levels, and difficulty levels. Unlike the previous games,  this is a graphics driven game where the player controls a small character who can move between four cannons. These cannons correspond to possible answers of a math question found at the bottom of the screen. The core mechanics of this game are to read the math question, move the character on top of a cannon, and shoot the cannon.

            <p style="color: rgb(52, 0, 134);">
                The target audience for this game are students in grades one to six. As the name suggests, the key teaching goals revolve around math and logic. Specifically, the game focuses on general adding/subtracting, multiplying/dividing and in later levels, fraction, decimals, and percentages. Furthermore, the game has a special feature in which specialized questions can be inputted (presumably by teachers and guardians).

            <p style="color: rgb(52, 0, 134);">
                Math Blaster! has continued its legacy by being “re-released countless times for various consoles and computer” (Belgin, 2018). According to Classic reload, Math Blaster! “represents a pivotal moment in the history of educational gaming” because it “showed that learning doesn’t have to be boring—it can be a thrilling experience” (Math Blaster: In Search of Spot, 2025). Not only did it start its own game series, but its “influence [can be] felt in modern titles” because of its “emphasis on making math enjoyable through interactive learning”(Math Blaster: In Search of Spot, 2025).
                Math Blaster is significant to the educational games industry due to its lasting, innovative ideas. “The foundation laid by Math Blaster, using storytelling, problem-solving, and interactive challenges… has influenced countless other educational games.” (Math Blaster: In Search of Spot, 2025).
