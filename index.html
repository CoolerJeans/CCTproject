                Through this exhibit, I would like to advocate towards educational games enhancing both the learning and game industry. I would like to explore the idea that “educational games are not only revolutionizing education but also significantly impacting the gaming industry” (EDU3LABS, 2024). Statistically speaking, the educational gaming industry is booming. According to Murrey, “95 percent of teachers say they have used video games designed for educational use in their classrooms”(Murray, 2024). Certain games from previous decades have certainly paved the road for the success of current educational games. I would like to present artifacts that have made their historical mark towards the evolution of educational games. I will do so by introducing each game, their academic role, and their lasting legacy and impact.             </p>
