                While educational games have much debate and statistics towards their enhancement to the educational system, I would like to advocate towards educational games enhancing the game industry. I would like to explore the idea that “educational games are not only revolutionizing education but also significantly impacting the gaming industry” (first source). Statistically speaking, the educational gaming industry is booming. (talk a little about the stats behind it). Certain games have certainly paved the road for the success of these games. I would like to present games that have made their historical mark towards the evolution of educational games. I will do so by introducing each game, their academic role, and their lasting legacy and impact.
