                The Sumerian Game, written and created in 1964, is known to be the first educational video game. Made for the classroom, the device students used to play it was an IBM 1050 terminal, whose output was printed out on paper and the input was through a keyboard. These devices connect to an IBM 7090 which is a computer and projector duo which presented a slide show cut scene for the game. 
                The gameplay has the player being a ruler of a kingdom wherein they must make inventory decisions to feed and care for their people. The basic game mechanics are reading information about resources and a question (e.g. “how many bushels of grain do you want PLANTED for the next crop?”) from the printer then inputting decisions into the keyboard and finally, receiving the outcome of the decision (in printed form).
