                Number Munchers is a math game that was published by MECC in 1990. The game was released on the platforms Apple 11, MS-DOS and Macintosh. The player controls a number muncher character (a green alien looking guy) who jumps around on a grid from box to box, each box containing a number. The control mechanics of Number Munchers follow the arrow keys (or joystick) for moving, the space bar for eating numbers and the enter bar for pausing the game. The goal of the game is to eat all the numbers that match with the prompt found at the top of the screen before being caught by the Troggluses (monster looking characters). Despite the pixelated  graphics, Number Munchers is a visually driven game. Unlike Oregon Trail and The Sumerian Game, Number Munchers cannot be played without its visuals. The core mechanics of the game include jumping from box to box, and “eating” numbers.

                The general learning goals of Number Munchers is to teach a greater understanding of numbers. As seen through the artifact picture, the game tests the player on their understanding of multiples, however there are also other levels the player can choose from such as factors, primes, equalities, and inequalities.
